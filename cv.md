### About myself

15 years ago I've started my career as a self-taught photographer.  It was way with falls and rises, but i've never give up. Hardest task gives more fun. I become an advanced Photoshop and Lightroom user, i learned how to talk with people, how to understand their needs. Making website to entroduce self as a professional started my way in fronend development. I've learned HTML and CSS.

Right now I have a side work as a wesite support. Work with others projects gave me expirience with team work, working in deadlines, professional growth by solving interesting and unusual for me tasks.

### Code example

This is my solution for codewars KATA:
Complete the solution so that it returns true if it contains any duplicate argument values. Any number of arguments may be passed into the function.

The array values passed in will only be strings or numbers. The only valid return values are true and false.

`function solution(...arg){
 const set = [...new Set(arg)];
  if( set.length === arg.length) {
    return false
  }
  return true
}`
